- Fixes:
    - Update after insertion and then reload info did not show anything since there was nothing to update.
        Now it checks if an update has occurred, if not it inserts it
    - RandomChooserActivity new list check if name already exists
    - Fixed problems with wrong option being run when selected (select local delete all and option
        online delete all being run)

- Dialog shown when deleting online cashBox
